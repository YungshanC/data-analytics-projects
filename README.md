# House Price Prediction Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.
The analysis explores how different housing features influence property prices
and evaluates the performance of regression models for price prediction.
## Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:
- Property size
- Number of rooms
- Location-related features
- Other housing characteristics
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
## Model Results & Interpretation
The analysis shows that factors such as property size and location-related features
have a significant impact on house prices.
Regression models were trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics,
highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach.
## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
and machine learning model development for real-world prediction tasks.
