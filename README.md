# House Price Prediction Project
## Business Context
This project simulates a real-world housing price prediction scenario,
where historical housing data is used to estimate property values based on
location, size, and socio-economic factors.

## Analytical Approach
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand key price drivers
- Built and evaluated regression models to predict housing prices
- Compared model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics

## Key Insights
- Location-related variables have a significant impact on housing prices
- Median income is one of the strongest predictors
- Linear regression provides a strong baseline for price estimation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Regression analysis
